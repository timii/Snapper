# Snapper

Your easy-to-use chrome extension for taking screenshots in your browser.

## Installation

**Option 1** -> Go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and search for "Snapper" or follow the [direct link to the extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snapper/opchjelombkjeoleoaganhaofjgjnbod) and press `Add to Chrome`.

**Option 2** -> Install it from source:

- clone/download this repo,
- open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`,
- enable "Developer mode",
- click "Load unpacked extension",
- select the cloned folder of this repo.

If you can see the icon in the top right of your browser, the installation was successful.

## Usage

Use the extension by clicking on the icon in the top right of Chrome. You can see a selection of options for
the area you want to screenshot:

- Custom Area: choose your own area to screenshot
- Visible Content: screenshot only the content currently visible
- Full Page: screenshot the whole website

> Tip: If none of the options work right after adding the extension to chrome, refresh the website you want to screenshot and it should work as expected afterwards.

After the screenshot has been taken, you will be redirected to a new tab showcasing the created screenshot with an option to download the image.
